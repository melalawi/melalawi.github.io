## What It Is

Genotify was written in collaboration with Jared Andrews, a PhD candidate at Washington University in St. Louis. It's a browser extension that addresses an annoyance for clinicians and researchers by allowing for in-text referencing of gene symbols. This saves users the hassle of looking up a gene just to get a basic description of what it does. By simply highlighting a gene symbol, a small blurb describing its function will appear.

The functions are pulled from the [UniProtKB database](http://www.uniprot.org/).
